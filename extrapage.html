                    <p>
                        A one Day International (ODI) is a type of limited-overs cricket game played between two international teams in which 
                        each team is given a certain amount of overs, currently 50, and the game can run up to 9 hours. This format is used for 
                        the Cricket World Cup, which is contested every four years. Limited Overs Internationals (LOI) refers to One Day 
                        International matches, although this word may also apply to Twenty20 International matches. They are big matches that 
                        represent the pinnacle of List A limited-overs cricket.

                        The international one-day game was developed in the late twentieth century. On January 5, 1971, the Melbourne Cricket 
                        Ground hosted the first One-Day International between Australia and England. When the third Test was washed out for the 
                        first three days, officials opted to call the game off and instead play a one-off one-day encounter with 40 eight-ball 
                        overs per side. By a margin of 5 wickets, Australia won the game. The ODIs were played using a red ball and white kits.

                        Kerry Packer founded the rival World Series Cricket competition in the late 1970s, and it introduced many of the 
                        features of One Day International cricket that are now standard, such as coloured uniforms, matches played at night under 
                        floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds 
                        from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics for television broadcasts. The WSC Australians in wattle gold versus 
                        the WSC West Indians in coral pink, contested at VFL Park in Melbourne on January 17, 1979, was the first match using 
                        colored outfits. Not only did this result in Packer's Channel 9 obtaining the television rights to cricket in Australia, 
                        but it also resulted in players all over the world being paid to play and becoming international pros, no longer requiring 
                        outside employment. Over time, matches using colored flannels and a white ball grew increasingly regular, and the use of 
                        white flannels and a red ball in ODIs was phased out in 2001.

                        A normal Twenty20 match takes roughly three hours, with each innings running around 90 minutes and a 10-minute break in 
                        between. This is a considerably shorter version of the game than earlier versions, and it is more in line with other 
                        popular team sports. It was created to create a fast-paced game that would appeal to both spectators and television 
                        viewers.

                        The shorter the match, the finer the margins; the finer the margins, the smaller the advantage one team has over another.

                        Test cricket is the longest format of cricket and is considered to be the highest level of the game. Test matches are 
                        contested between national representative teams that have been awarded Test status by the International Cricket Council, 
                        as determined and conferred (ICC). They're termed Tests because matches are mentally and physically demanding due to their 
                        duration and difficulty. A four-innings match between two teams of 11 players can last up to five days (or more in the past; 
                        contests with no time limit were known as Timeless Tests). It is widely regarded as the most comprehensive test of a team's endurance 
                        and ability. <br>
                        The first legally recognized Test match was contested between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground 
                        between March 15 and 19, 1877. (MCG). The International Cricket Council (ICC) revised the playing conditions for Test 
                        matches in October 2012, allowing for day/night Test matches. On the 27th and 1st of December 2015, Australia and 
                        New Zealand played the first day/night game at the Adelaide Oval in Adelaide.
